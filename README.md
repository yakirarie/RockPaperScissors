## About The Project
This game is my interpretation of the classic ICQ's RPS Online.
I used the **pygame** framework with the help of a youtube checkers tutorial and my python knowledge to create this game with an AI opponent.

The rules are simple:
- Whoever gets the opponent flag first - Wins.
- Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock.
- Each battle win will result of an exposer of the winner (expect the Trap piece).
- Any draw battles will result of both pieces removed.
- Special pieces: Flag and Trap (Both are unmovable pieces)-
    - Flag: The game's trophy. Whoever's flag is being captured - Loses.
    - Trap: Undefeated piece. Whoever attacks the trap will be removed without the trap being exposed.
